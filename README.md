# üåø Plant-O-Matic (TOPSOILER)

An **Arduino-based autonomous irrigation and lighting system** designed to maintain ideal soil conditions for your plants through periodic moisture monitoring, pump control, and light cycles. Version 0.2 of the firmware incorporates power-saving sensor management, OLED status display, and safety wiring checks.

---

## üìñ Overview

Plant-O-Matic automates plant watering by sensing soil moisture and activates a pump only when needed. It also manages a grow light cycle and outputs real-time status on an OLED display, making it a self-sufficient smart plant system.

## üß† Core Firmware Features

- **Automated Soil Moisture Sensing:** Checks moisture every 8 hours, maps readings to 0-100% scale.
- **Pump Control:** Waters plants for a configurable duration when moisture falls below threshold.
- **Grow Light Cycling:** Toggles light on/off every 8 hours to simulate natural lighting conditions.
- **OLED Status Display:** Shows version, moisture values (current + previous two readings), plant status emoji, and cycle time.
- **Wiring Check:** Validates sensor, pump, and light wiring on startup with user feedback.
- **Power Saving:** Sensor power controlled strategically, reducing wear and preserving accuracy.
- **Serial Debugging:** Logs data and system states when in DEBUG mode.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deploying Firmware

1. Clone the repo and open `AutoPlant.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Select Arduino Nano or UNO board and set the correct COM port.
3. Upload the firmware.
4. Open serial monitor at 9600 baud to read logs.
5. The system will run automatically checking moisture, cycling water and light, and updating the display.
